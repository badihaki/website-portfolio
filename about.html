            <h2>About this Guy</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a freelance illustrator from Atlanta, Georgia, specializing in <br>
                character design, concept art and sequential illustration. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked with a variety of clients in the music industry, as well as my own <br>
                creator owned projects. I have an interest in game design and development, and <br>
                that is where my passion for programming comes from. I've started quite a few <br>
                projects in the Unity game engine, and quickly familiarized myself with the base <br>
                fundamentals of programming, as well as a general understanding of C#. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this course, I hope to better grasp my understanding of programming as a <br>
                skill, as well as expanding my knowledge of a variety of programming languages.
