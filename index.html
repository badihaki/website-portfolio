                Welcome to my online Portfolio, created as part of the Flatiron FLEX program!
                <br>
                Here you will find a repository of artwork I did over the course of 2021. A lot of these are really, really bad. Please don't judge too harshly, haha!
                <br> 
                You'll find I'm a big sci-fi and fantasy nerd, and that's what a lot of my stuff draws influence from.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be updating this website over time. Please be patient.
            </p>
